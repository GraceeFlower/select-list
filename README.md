# Select-list made by CSS3
This is a select-list about Saite Petersburg (Haha, you can change to anywhere you like~) , and the list contains three items, they are:   
- Like  
- Favorites  
- Discuss  

Each of them is an independent link, but now it's linking to the index page.  
At the beginning, the list is hidden.  
You can hover your mouse over the triangle next to the *Saite Petersburg*, and see!  
 It's here~
